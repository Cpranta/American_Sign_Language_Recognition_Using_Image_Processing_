# American_Sign_Language_Recognition_Using_Image_Processing_
There are many people in this world who canâ€™t hear and speak properly. Sign language is created for them to communicate with others. In this manuscript, we discuss about Recognition of American Sign Language using machine learning algorithms. In the computer vision field, sign language images are classified in many ways. In this paper, we discuss about classifying sign language images using many algorithms with the dataset which have 36 different classes and was collected from. The dataset provides a set of 26 sign alphabets and 10 numeric gestures (0 to 9). Some preprocessing methods, feature extraction with Hog feature is applied before model training and evaluation. To get the accuracy we applied SVM, KNN and Random Forest and Decision Tree. We get the best evaluation by using SVM which is 96%. In our proposed paper, we also discuss about related works, weakness and future work.
